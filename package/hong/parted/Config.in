          Say Y here if you would like to use hard disks under Linux which
	  were partitioned on a Macintosh.

	bool "BSD disklabel (FreeBSD partition tables) support"
	default n
	help
	  FreeBSD uses its own hard disk partition scheme on your PC. It 
	  requires only one entry in the primary partition table of your disk
	  and manages it similarly to DOS extended partitions, putting in its
	  first sector a new partition table in BSD disklabel format. Saying Y
	  here allows you to read these disklabels and further mount FreeBSD 
	  partitions from within Linux if you have also said Y to "UFS
	  file system support", above. If you don't know what all this is 
	  about, say N. 

config KERNEL_SOLARIS_X86_PARTITION
	depends KERNEL_MSDOS_PARTITION
	bool "Solaris (x86) partition table support"
	default n
	help
	  Like most systems, Solaris x86 uses its own hard disk partition
	  table format, incompatible with all others. Saying Y here allows you
	  to read these partition tables and further mount Solaris x86
	  partitions from within Linux if you have also said Y to "UFS
	  file system support", above.

config KERNEL_EFI_PARTITION
	bool "Enable EFI Partition parsing support in the kernel"
